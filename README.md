# School Data

All data was pulled from two csv files, "schools_complete.csv" & "students_complete.csv"

The data was then cleaned in a jupyter notebook to be analysed


# Entire County

In this dataframe there is a full view of the entire county's numbers including Student population, Average scores, and Percentage passing per subject

After breaking this data down you can see the average scores and passing rates per budget:

To determine the best and worst performing schools the data was broken down between each school with the worst being:

and the best being:

these dataframes also add the new category of Per Student Budget to help determine what is causing schools to succeed or fail

# Conclusion

Taking any set of data and cleaning to the level is important to finding solutions to major problems. Quick glances show that on a macro:

1. Charter Schools score better than District
2. Medium sized Schools score better than larger and smaller schools
3. Budget per student is an unreliable set of data

This also helps identify the issues on a micro level, specifically which schools need the most help.
